Variables

Task: Make your own variable and assign it your age as an integer (a whole number).

Example:
To make a var you can use the 'var' keyword
For example, I might write: var pet = "dog".
This means the variable named 'pet' has the value of 'dog'

To see the contents of this variable in the console I can write:
console.log(pet)
