Conditionals

Task: Add a condition after your age variable that provides the user a message

Example:
I can use if and else statements.
Look at the code below:

if (pet == "dog") {
    console.log("I love dogs!")
}
else {
    console.log("Have you considered getting a dog?")
}

Here I am saying that if the value of the variable "pet", is equal to "dog" then do the thing in the brackets (log a message to the console).
If the statement after the "if" is false - so pet does not equal "dog" - then the "else" statement will come into effect (logging a different message to the console).
