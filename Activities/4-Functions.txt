Function activity

Example of a function:
A person has Â£300. They want to buy an item and work out the change.
This crude function receives the costOfItem and returns the change from 300.

function calcMyMoney (costOfItem) {
    return 300 - costOfItem
}

Let's use the function by giving it the costOfItem, and assigning the value to a new variable called myMoneyLeft:
    var myMoneyLeft = calcMyMoney(100)

Let's view it in the console:
    console.log(myMoneyLeft)

Aim for this activity: Add a function that receives your birth year and returns your age
Tip: The current year - your birth year = your age
