Well done on writing your first function!
Now we want to give the function some input from the user.

The first thing to try is to write the following and run it:
    prompt("Can you see my question?)

You should have seen your question with an input box to type a response. We can capture that response in a variable like this:
    var itemCostPromptValue = prompt("What is the cost of the item?")

The value written into the prompt box is assigned to the variable itemCostPromptValue. I can then use this variable by passing it into my function:

    var myMoneyLeft = calcMyMoney(itemCostPromptValue)
    console.log(myMoneyLeft)

Activity: Can you do something similar using your age function from the last exercise?
