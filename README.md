# Tech Academy Introduction to Coding Activities
By Amy Haley & Sam Holman

## Machine set up
We recommend using Visual Studio Code that has the extension 'Live Server' installed.

To install Live Server, click on the 'Extensions' icon on the left hand side of VSCode. Search for 'Live Server'. Install.

You will now be able to click the 'Go Live' text in the bottom right of the VSCode window, this will open the activity page within your web browser.

Right click in the window and select 'Inspect'.

Now click 'Console'.

This is where the output of your code file will be visible.
